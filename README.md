# Go Calculator

Hello there, fellow code explorer! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I've built a fun and interactive calculator using Go and a sprinkle of web server magic. This project was my playground to learn Go and understand the basics of web servers. So, if you're ready to dive in, let's get started!

## What's Inside?

This project is a simple yet powerful calculator that can evaluate mathematical expressions. It's built using Go and it serves a neat little HTML page where you can input your equations and get results in real time.

The Go server uses the `github.com/Knetic/govaluate` package to parse and evaluate the equations. The HTML page uses JavaScript to send the equations to the server and display the results.

## How to Run

Running this project is as easy as 1-2-3:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `go run main.go`.

Then, open your favorite web browser and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Voila! You're now ready to crunch some numbers!

## What I Learned

This project was a fantastic journey through the land of Go and web servers. Here are some of the cool things I learned:

- How to set up a basic Go server.
- How to handle HTTP requests in Go.
- How to serve static files (like our calculator HTML page) from a Go server.
- How to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions in Go.
- How to use JavaScript to interact with a server.

## Join the Adventure

Feel free to explore the code, play around with it, and make it your own. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
